# To Do # 

## Most Recent ##

* Created a beginning game animation for the start screen, and another for the game menu.
* Added function calls for both canvas scenes to the phases in Game.init

## Next ##

* Design classes and methods for handling animations in scenes
* Integrate scene animations with map/menu grids (store grid information in the menu itself, rather than in the animation code)

## Some Day ##

* Refactor all methods to return the original object, for method chaining
